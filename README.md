# ways-of-ui-testing

This repository holds examples for the article ***UI Testing mit Spa√üfaktor*** published in the german magazine ***Softwerker***.

The article describes my own experiences and common problems when testing ui interfaces. Followed by some suggestions to avoid these problems and building a new mindset. Finally this article compares the VueTestingLibrary to the vue-test-utils and cypress and this is where this repository comes into play. Find the used test examples [here](/tests).
